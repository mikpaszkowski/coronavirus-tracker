Simple Coronavirus-Tracker Application

https://coronavirus-tracker-2020.herokuapp.com/

Tech Stack:

1. HTML + Bootstrap 4 + Thymeleaf 3 (Spring)
2. Java (Spring Boot)
3. Upload -> Heroku

The main source of the data for this app is a repository on github.
We can find there a csv file with a up-to-date data about the reported/death/recovery cases
of COVID-19. 

The back of the application is reading these data from the CSV file. With a filtering these data
we can possibly extract the requested numbers of the cases from exact countires and simply put them
in the front of the website with a hand of Thymeleaf and HTML. 

These app was one of my first during my (let's say) career. The styles was skipped beacuse of the usage of
bootstrap. The main goal of these project was only creating a 'full-stack' app which could be
uploaded (this app was uploaded on Heroku) and work in the background.

I am aware that this project has a lot of drawbacks... :D
